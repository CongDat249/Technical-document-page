            CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more
            complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can
            help. Sass has features that don't exist in CSS yet like nesting,
            mixins, inheritance, and other nifty goodies that help you write
            robust, maintainable CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed
            Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in your
            website.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once
            Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass
            command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and
            where to output CSS to. For example, running sass input.scss
            output.css from your terminal would take a single Sass file,
            input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch
            flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for
            changes, and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you
            wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your input.scss file,
            you'd just add the watch flag to your command, like so
          </p>
          <code> sass --watch input.scss output.css </code>
          <p>
            You can watch and output to directories by using folder paths as
            your input and output, and separating them with a colon. In this
            example
          </p>
          <code>sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets </code>
          <p>
            Sass would watch all files in the app/sass folder for changes, and
            compile CSS to the public/stylesheets folder.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
          <header>Variables</header>
          <p>
            Think of variables as a way to store information that you want to
            reuse throughout your stylesheet. You can store things like colors,
            font stacks, or any CSS value you think you'll want to reuse. Sass
            uses the $ symbol to make something a variable. Here's an example:
          </p>
          <code>
            <span class="green">$font-stack</span> :Helvetica, sans-serif;
            <br />
            <span class="green">$primary-color</span>: #333;
            <br />

            body {
            <br />
            <span class="red">font</span>:
            <span class="green">100% $font-stack;</span>
            <br />
            <span class="red">color</span>:
            <span class="green">$primary-color</span>
            <br />
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            When the Sass is processed, it takes the variables we define for the
            $font-stack and $primary-color and outputs normal CSS with our
            variable values placed in the CSS. This can be extremely powerful
            when working with brand colors and keeping them consistent
            throughout the site.

        <section class="main-section" id="Nesting">
          <header>Nesting</header>
          <p>
            When writing HTML you've probably noticed that it has a clear nested
            and visual hierarchy. CSS, on the other hand, doesn't. Sass will let
            you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual
            hierarchy of your HTML. Be aware that overly nested rules will
            result in over-qualified CSS that could prove hard to maintain and
            is generally considered bad practice. With that in mind, here's an
            example of some typical styles for a site's navigation:
          </p>
          <!-- prettier-ignore -->
          <code>
			  <img src="imgs/nesting.png" alt="">
		  </code>
          <p>
            You'll notice that the ul, li, and a selectors are nested inside the
            nav selector. This is a great way to organize your CSS and make it
            more readable.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Partials">
          <header>Partials</header>
          <p>
            You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of
            CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to
            modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A
            partial is a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might
            name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know
            that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be
            generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @use
            rule.
          </p>
          <code>@use</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Modules">
          <header>Modules</header>
          <p>
            You don't have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can
            split it up however you want with the @use rule. This rule loads
            another Sass file as a module, which means you can refer to its
            variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass file with a namespace
            based on the filename. Using a file will also include the CSS it
            generates in your compiled output!
          </p>
          <code>
            <img src="imgs/modules.png" alt="" />
          </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Mixins">
          <header>Mixins</header>
          <p>
            Some things in CSS are a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3
            and the many vendor prefixes that exist. A mixin lets you make
            groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your
            site. You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible.
            A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. Here's an example for
            transform.
          </p>
          <code>
            <img src="imgs/mixins.png" alt="" />
          </code>
          <p>
            To create a mixin you use the @mixin directive and give it a name.
            We've named our mixin transform. We're also using the variable
            $property inside the parentheses so we can pass in a transform of
            whatever we want. After you create your mixin, you can then use it
            as a CSS declaration starting with @include followed by the name of
            the mixin.
          </p>

          <header>Extend and Inheritance</header>

          </code>
          <p>
            What the above code does is tells .message, .success, .error, and
            .warning to behave just like %message-shared. That means anywhere
            that %message-shared shows up, .message, .success, .error, &
            .warning will too. The magic happens in the generated CSS, where
            each of these classes will get the same CSS properties as
            %message-shared. This helps you avoid having to write multiple class
            names on HTML elements. You can extend most simple CSS selectors in
            addition to placeholder classes in Sass, but using placeholders is
            the easiest way to make sure you aren't extending a class that's
            nested elsewhere in your styles, which can result in unintended
            selectors in your CSS. Note that the CSS in %equal-heights isn't
            generated, because %equal-heights is never extended.
